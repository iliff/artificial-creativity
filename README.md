# artificial-creativity

main repo for our musings around language, translation and creativity.

I am not sure if we want to use this repo or another one for the translation work @timothybeal and @jobarber are working on presently, but we most certainly can put those here. 

I will use this repo to begin experimenting with some tutorial and documentation options using things like jupyter notebooks, etc. GitHub will render jupyter notebooks with limited functionality, which might offer us a simple way to get a few things mounted (we may need to make this repo public for these to be accessible to public.)
